Repo for a python project for the next 12 weeks.

**Week 3**

This was my first coding project ever. My mentor *Meili* and I charted out the plan for 12 weeks. 
This is week 3 and I have started doing some Python exercises and have begun getting my head wrapped around an IDE - PyCharm. 
Working in an IDE is different from learning a language using an online editor.
I needed to understand **IDE**.
Before I could begin coding in PyCharm I had to configure an set up Python 3.7 as the intepretor.
Learning f strings and variables. Python being an object oriented language does not require you to declare variables before using them. You declare and initialize *at the same time*.
