Repo for a python project for the next 12 weeks.
**Week 3**
This was my first coding project ever. My mentor Meili and I charted out the plan for 12 weeks. 
This is week 3 and I have started doing some Python exercises and have begun getting my head wrapped around an IDE - PyCharm. Working in an IDE is different from learning a language using an online editor.I needed to understand the before I could begin coding in PyCharm I had to configure an set up Python 3.7 as the intepretor.
